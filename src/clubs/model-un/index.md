The **Model United Nations (MUN) Club** offers students the chance to role-play as diplomats representing countries at national and international conferences. Delegates work individually or in pairs to represent their assigned country in **committees** that focus on world issues, with opportunities to participate in **advanced committees** for experienced members.  

Preparation includes occasional meetings before each conference, where students practice research, position papers, and public speaking. At conferences such as **PHILMUN, RUMUN, ILMUN, and AMERIMUN**, delegates engage in debate, negotiate with other countries, and draft **resolutions** addressing global challenges.  

Beyond debate, conferences also feature **awards for outstanding delegates** and **social events**, making MUN both a competitive and community experience.  

New members often begin with **RUMUN or PHILMUN**, which are welcoming to first-time delegates. The club provides guidance and support to help all students gain confidence, learn diplomacy, and develop valuable leadership skills.
