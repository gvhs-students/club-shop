The CS Club welcomes all students interested in computer science, whether beginner or experienced.  
Members meet weekly to learn and collaborate, and the club provides opportunities beyond the classroom.  

Each fall, the club organizes an **annual trip to Lockheed Martin** during school hours, giving students direct exposure to real-world applications of computer science in industry.  

In addition, CS Club members **volunteer, organize, and compete** at the local **“Hack the Valley” hackathon** hosted at Microsoft’s Malvern Office. The club also encourages participation in various **computer science Olympiads**, helping students challenge themselves and grow their skills.  

Students are free to attend meetings whenever they are able. All are welcome to join.
