## About us

The GVHS Robotics Club gives students the chance to design, build, and program robots using the **VEX V5** platform. Our club is divided into six teams, each with about 4–6 members, who work together throughout the year to prepare for competitions. Students can either form their own team with friends or be placed on an existing team if they prefer.  

Teams may compete at **local, state, and even world-level competitions**, depending on their progress through the season. Over the years, GVHS Robotics has proudly earned recognition and awards at different levels of competition.  

Membership fees vary from year to year, and details are provided directly in the club room along with the necessary forms and information packets.  

Whether you’re interested in **engineering, coding, teamwork, or competition**, there’s a place for you in Robotics Club. We welcome new members who want to learn hands-on technical skills, make friends, and take part in one of the most exciting STEM experiences GVHS has to offer.
